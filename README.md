# Monster 3-Star Elemental and Status Ailment Weakness (Iceborne-Ready)

**Changes every monster's icon to show their weaknesses to elements and ailments that are 3 stars. This mod adds the weaknesses with Hi-res icons for Iceborne, all I did was add the 3-star ailments as well. Credit to the makers of hunters-guide for showing the ailments and weaknesses.**

As the overview states this mod shows the 3-star ailments as well as the elemental ailments on all the monster icons.

I spent a good amount of time to getting the pictures just right, so please endorse if you like the result, or the mod alone.
